# check-that-bump

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://probot.github.io) that listens for a new or reopened pull request and reads from the diff from the package.json to see if the version has been incremented on an open PR. If it has not, it will request changes on your PR and leave a comment. 

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Contributing
